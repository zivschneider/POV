The vehicle failed to stop and drove off into a farm field. 
Officers lost sight of the vehicle (van), 
but located it a short time later on a dirt road near the canal. A search of the area located one subject who indicated that he and a female had climbed the fence and jumped in the canal. 
The subject took officers to the location she was last seen and indicated that after jumping in, he never saw her re-surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;A search of the area by Pinal county rescue was negative. 
The decedent was found the following morning in the canal; unknown at this time if she was found in the same area she jumped into.&nbsp;In the area she was located, the water was traveling 374 CFS and was 20' deep.</span></span></p>
